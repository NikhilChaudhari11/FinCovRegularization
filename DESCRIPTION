Description: This is a package for the covariance matrix estimation and regularization of asset returns. For covariance matrix
    estimation, three major types of factor models are included: macroeconomic factor model, fundamental factor model and
    statistical factor model. For covariance matrix regularization, four regularized estimators are included: banding, tapering,
    hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding. The tuning parameters of these regularized estimators are selected via cross-validation.
